**GARVIT SIWACH**

I am a Computer Science undergraduate with a solid foundation in core programming concepts, including Data Structures, Algorithms, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). My understanding of these fundamental concepts enables me to write efficient and optimized code, solve complex computational problems, and design scalable software solutions. Data Structures and Algorithms provide me with the ability to structure data logically and perform operations effectively, which is essential for tackling coding challenges, building high-performance applications, and participating in competitive programming. Object-Oriented Programming further enhances my skills by allowing me to design modular, reusable, and maintainable code, which is critical for large-scale software development. In addition to my programming foundation, I am proficient in front-end web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. I enjoy building interactive and visually appealing web applications that provide an excellent user experience. My front-end skills include designing responsive layouts, implementing dynamic user interfaces, and ensuring seamless user interactions. I focus not only on functionality but also on aesthetics, creating applications that are intuitive and engaging. Alongside front-end expertise, I have hands-on experience with back-end development using Node.js and Express. This allows me to build full-stack applications with robust server-side logic, database integration, and RESTful APIs. My experience in both front-end and back-end development equips me to create complete web solutions from scratch, ensuring smooth communication between the client and server. I am particularly passionate about problem-solving and enjoy designing creative solutions that balance functionality with user experience. Whether itâ€™s developing automation tools, UI/UX prototypes, or interactive web applications, I aim to combine technical proficiency with innovation. My projects reflect a dedication to building real-world applications that address practical needs while maintaining high usability standards. I am motivated by challenges that push my technical skills and creativity, and I am continuously seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge in building efficient, user-friendly, and innovative software solutions. Overall, my technical foundation, combined with practical experience in both front-end and back-end development, positions me as a capable and versatile developer, ready to contribute effectively to software projects and deliver solutions that are both functional and engaging.# Garvit-Portfolio
